# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests are in number theory and arithmetic geometry. In particular I am interested in the $p$-adic aspects of the Langlands program and in the theory of $p$-adic variations of automorphic forms. I am also interested in formal proofs, especially Lean.

interests:
- Langlands program
- Eigenvarieties
- $p$-adic families of automorphic forms
- Formal proofs

Hi! I am a _Maître de conférences_ (= tenured associate professor) at the [Université de Paris](https://u-paris.fr/) in the [Departement of Mathematics](https://www.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), working in the [automorphic forms group](http://www.imj-prg.fr/fa/) at the [Institut de Mathématiques de Jussieu-Paris Rive Gauche](http://www.imj-prg.fr/). My main research interests are in number theory and arithmetic geometry. I am also member of the ANR project [CoLoSS](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-19-CE40-0015).

Recently, I have become interested in formal proofs and proof assistants, especially [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) and its [Mathematical Library](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). I actively participate to the [Liquid Tensor Experiment](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/). If you want to try to formalize some mathematics, the I strongly suggest to try the [Natural Number Game](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/).

I have been a post-doc at the [ENS-Lyon](http://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/) under the supervision of [Vincent Pilloni](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/vincent.pilloni/) and at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/). I completed my PhD in March 2012 under the supervision of [Fabrizio Andreatta](http://users.mat.unimi.it/users/andreat/) at the [Università degli Studi di Milano](http://www.matematica.unimi.it/ecm/home).
