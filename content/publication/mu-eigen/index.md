abstract: "We develop Hida theory for Shimura varieties of type A without ordinary locus. In particular we show that the dimension of the space of ordinary forms is bounded independently of the weight and that there is a module of $\\Lambda$-adic cuspidal ordinary forms which is of finite type over $\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a twisted Iwasawa algebra.
