abstract: "We generalize some of the results of Andreatta, Iovita, and Pilloni and the author to Hodge type Shimura varieties having non-empty ordinary locus. For any $p$-adic weight $\\kappa$, we give a geometric definition of the space of overconvergent modular forms of weight $\\kappa$ in terms of sections of a sheaf. We show that our sheaves live in analytic families, interpolating the classical sheaves for integral weights. We define an action of the Hecke algebra, including a completely continuous operator at $p$. In some simple cases, we also build the eigenvariety."
