abstract: "The aim of these notes is to give a short introduction to P. Scholze’s theory of perfectoid spaces and their applications. These notes arise from a summer school “Perfectoid Spaces” held in Bressanone (IT) from 31st august to 4th september 2015 in the framework of the Erasmus Mundus master programme ALGANT. The aim was to introduce perfectoid spaces to last year master students."
