abstract: "Generalising the recent method of Andreatta, Iovita, and Pilloni for cuspidal forms, we construct an eigenvariety for symplectic and unitary groups that parametrises systems of eigenvalues of overconvergent and locally analytic $p$-adic automorphic forms. This is achieved by gluing some intermediates eigenvarieties of a fixed 'degree of cuspidality'. The dimension of these eigenvarieties is explicit and depends on the degree of cuspidality, it is maximal for cuspidal forms and it is $1$ for forms that are “not cuspidal at all”. Under mild assumption, we are able to prove a conjecture of Urban about the dimension of the irreducible components of Hansen's eigenvariety in the case of the group $\\mathrm{GSp}_4$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.
